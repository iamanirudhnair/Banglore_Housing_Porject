Regression Project - Developed a Bangalore property price prediction website employing Linear Regression, feature engineering, outlier removal, and hyper parameter tuning, deployed on AWS cloud with a Flask server, showcasing expertise in regression modeling and web deployment.

We did Bangalore property Price Prediction Project where we built an end to end website where we can enter our parameters like our bedrooms, sq ft areas and so 
on and the website would tell us the predicted price for that home. We built this website where the model was trained using simple Linear regression and before 
training the model, we did outlier removal, dimenstionality reduction, a lot of feature engineering techniques then we built the model optimized it, hyper 
paramter tuning using GridSearchCV then we deployed the model to AWS cloud and there was a flask server running on top of it which was serving the request that 
were coming from the website. So this way we learn a lot of solutions, a lot of technical skills.
